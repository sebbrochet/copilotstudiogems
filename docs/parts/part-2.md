# Part II — Personalization

Your agent works. Now make it adapt to **who it's talking to** — their role, language, expertise level, and preferences.

## What You'll Learn

| Gem | Pattern | Key Question |
|---|---|---|
| **[GEM-002](../gems/GEM-002-persona-adaptive-agent-instructions.md)** | Persona-Adaptive Agent Instructions | How does the agent adjust tone and depth per user? |
| **[GEM-005](../gems/GEM-005-multi-language-agent-response.md)** | Multi-Language Agent Response | How does the agent detect and respond in the user's language? |
| **[GEM-020](../gems/GEM-020-agent-instructions-as-living-documents.md)** | Agent Instructions as Living Documents | How do you version, modularize, and A/B test instructions? |

## Prerequisites

- **[GEM-001](../gems/GEM-001-persisting-user-context-across-sessions.md)** (Part I) — most personalization patterns persist user preferences across sessions

## The Core Challenge

Agent instructions are static by default — one set of instructions for all users. This Part shows three dimensions of adaptation: **persona** ([GEM-002](../gems/GEM-002-persona-adaptive-agent-instructions.md)), **language** ([GEM-005](../gems/GEM-005-multi-language-agent-response.md)), and **instruction lifecycle** ([GEM-020](../gems/GEM-020-agent-instructions-as-living-documents.md)).
