# Part VI — Knowledge & Performance

The agent's intelligence is only as good as its knowledge sources — and only as sustainable as its cost model.

## What You'll Learn

| Gem | Pattern | Key Question |
|---|---|---|
| **[GEM-008](../gems/GEM-008-knowledge-source-optimization.md)** | Knowledge Source Optimization | Why can't the agent find answers that are clearly in the documents? |
| **[GEM-012](../gems/GEM-012-cost-estimation-and-token-budget-management.md)** | Cost Estimation and Token Budget Management | How much does each conversation cost, and how do you control it? |
| **[GEM-026](../gems/GEM-026-azure-ai-search-advanced-integration.md)** | Azure AI Search Advanced Integration | When do you need enterprise search instead of SharePoint? |

## The Core Challenge

Two sides of the same coin: **quality** (does the agent find the right answer?) and **cost** (how much does it cost to find it?). [GEM-008](../gems/GEM-008-knowledge-source-optimization.md) is the starting point for every knowledge problem. [GEM-026](../gems/GEM-026-azure-ai-search-advanced-integration.md) is the escalation path when built-in knowledge sources aren't enough. [GEM-012](../gems/GEM-012-cost-estimation-and-token-budget-management.md) ensures you can afford it all.
