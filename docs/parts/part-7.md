# Part VII — Observability & Operations

You built and deployed the agent. Now: is it working? Is it helping? How do you know?

## What You'll Learn

| Gem | Pattern | Key Question |
|---|---|---|
| **[GEM-003](../gems/GEM-003-tracing-agent-progress-before-response.md)** | Tracing Agent Progress Before Response | How do you show users what the agent is doing while it thinks? |
| **[GEM-004](../gems/GEM-004-debug-mode-for-m365-copilot.md)** | Debug Mode for M365 Copilot Channel | How do you debug in channels where the Test Canvas doesn't exist? |
| **[GEM-013](../gems/GEM-013-testing-strategies-for-multi-agent-architectures.md)** | Testing Strategies for Multi-Agent Architectures | How do you systematically test an orchestrator + specialist agents? |
| **[GEM-016](../gems/GEM-016-conversation-analytics-and-quality-measurement.md)** | Conversation Analytics and Quality Measurement | Is the agent actually helping people? How do you measure it? |

## The Core Challenge

The agent is a black box once deployed. This Part makes it transparent — from real-time progress indicators ([GEM-003](../gems/GEM-003-tracing-agent-progress-before-response.md)) to production analytics ([GEM-016](../gems/GEM-016-conversation-analytics-and-quality-measurement.md)). Read [GEM-004](../gems/GEM-004-debug-mode-for-m365-copilot.md) first if you're debugging a deployed agent. Read [GEM-013](../gems/GEM-013-testing-strategies-for-multi-agent-architectures.md) before deploying a multi-agent architecture. Read [GEM-016](../gems/GEM-016-conversation-analytics-and-quality-measurement.md) after deployment to measure real-world impact.
