# About the Author

**Sébastien Brochet** is a technical professional specializing in AI agent development within the Microsoft ecosystem.

With experience spanning enterprise agent architectures, multi-agent orchestration patterns, and comprehensive technical documentation, Sébastien has built production Copilot Studio agents for global organizations — discovering the patterns, gotchas, and trade-offs documented in this book through real-world deployment.

His approach to technical knowledge: **evaluate, don't just demonstrate**. Every pattern should show multiple approaches with honest trade-offs — because the right answer depends on your context, not the author's preference.

## Acknowledgments

This book was shaped by:

- **Game Programming Gems** (Mark DeLoura) — for the "gem" format: self-contained, practical, expert-written solutions to recurring problems.
- **Design Patterns** (Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides) — for the principle that patterns should evaluate trade-offs, not prescribe one way.
- **The Copilot Studio community** — for the questions, bugs, workarounds, and shared discoveries that informed these patterns.
- **Microsoft Learn documentation** — the foundation that every Gem builds upon and extends.
